Count Version 2.0

This program counts upwards from 0 to 9.

  
  1  int i,a;
  2  main()
  3  {for (i=0;i<9;++i)
  4  {
  5  a=i;
  6  }}


The counting itself has to be watched with a debugger.

Set a breakpoint to line 2 or 3 and run the program.
Use the step- function to step through the program and watch the value in 
variable a which will contain the latest value of the counting.


Also the next- function can be used to watch the content of variable a.
