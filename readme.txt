Count Version 1.0

This program counts backwards from 9 to 0.

  1  main(){int a=9;
  2  while(a>0)
  3  {
  4  a--;
  5  }}

The counting itself has to be watched with a debugger.

Set a breakpoint to line 2 and use the step- function to step through
the program and watch the value in variable a.

Also the lines 3 and 4 can be used for the breakpoint, however in this
case the initial value can not be investigated.
